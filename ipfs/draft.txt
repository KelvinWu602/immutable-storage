  initialize node state:
    1st stage: lonely initialization
      0. create 2 public keys for each IPNS name
        nodestxt ==> nodes.txt
        mappings ==> mappings/
      1. create empty directory mappings/
      2. publish IPNS name for mappings/
      3. create nodes.txt with IPNS of mappings/ written
      4. create IPNS name for nodes.txt

    2nd stage: group initialization
      1. gossip broadcast your own IPNS of mappings/
      2. query 3 other nodes for their nodes.txt's IPNS
      3. for each unseen mappingIPNS, validate a random entry in it
      4. create a union of 3 validated results, use it as your own nodes.txt
      5. update your IPNS of nodes.txt
      6. start the round-robin update worker goroutine
